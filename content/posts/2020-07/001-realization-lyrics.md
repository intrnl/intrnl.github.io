Waiting for shining stars to fall

I am lost, and I'm found  
Walking in the darknes  
Looking for the star, every night

Who are you and who am I?  
Wandering around the town  
As you make it, I do missions

In the mist, can I trust you from my heart  
Will you always be my side  
Nobody knows the truth

Believe in myself  
Call me please if you need me  
I wanna be with you  
But if you don't need me  
What can I do, tell me

Realization for dreams, set me free  
and let me go do my best  
Imagination for truth, yes I know  
I am on this blue planet

You are lost and you're found  
Waiting for the daybreak  
Searching for the light, and escape

Where are you and where am I?  
Wandering around the space  
We can do it, we are creatures

In the end, can I follow you,  
without rules?  
Now the moonlight shows me my road  
Nobody knows the way

Believe in yourself  
Call you again 'cause I'm lonely  
I want to change my mind  
If life is to be fake  
I will shut down the door

Realization for pride, wake me now  
and get it more be myself  
But the nation for defense, yes we do  
Battle on this blue planet

I have a secret  
Keeping it in mind  
You can't read my heart  
Why did you help me?

Please stay with me  
Please leave me alone

So much emotions  
My heart's like a forest  
But I must keep running  
Go ahead, try!

Realization for dreams, set me free  
and let me go do my best  
Imagination for truth, yes I know  
I am on this blue planet

Realization for truth, wake me up  
and let me go be with you  
Imagination for dreams, yes I know  
You are on the same planet
