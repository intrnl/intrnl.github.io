Silence, so refreshing that sounds  
Envision, the moment we will have  
Right after, everything is dissolved

Demise, how beautiful it is  
Can't wait to destroy you all  
But you are quick, so very quick, trying hopelessly  
Don't make us disappointed every time

Innocent  
That's how we are, can't you see?  
Cause we have the power to clean out  
All the foulness, which means you into this world

Outrage  
You think we are, don't you know?  
Our hearts are made of metal, now all is gone  
Increasing nothingness, which is a mission of our existence

Don't you see we give you the sense,  
then to see we are generous  
Fly into the sky, fall with it

Are you ready to go insane? (ready to go insane?)  
We're sending our death threat for you (our death threat for you)  
Definitely in the universe!

All of you has to decide how long your might last  
Your deadening may come close  
Wonder when you became aware, can't win  
Many times it's cheekily

All had to was to decide how we invade your base  
It could beat the path until your time  
As the death will wait for you, you will survive this purge?  
Would you like to try, mixing you in again?

Now the frantic battle starts to feel the light

Distorted time space in the dark  
There is an absence of the light  
Before you blink, everything is wiped out, did they do all of this  
They have come, for all this way to eliminate us

We have battles and partings  
We've so much joy, love and sorrow  
Struggling, we hope and defend  
Yeah we can fight as we want together!

Now we have united the world  
These could be the last moments of our lives  
No matter how, they'd be stealing the time that comes  
Now we have united the stars  
Gotta put the past that lingers behind  
There must be, the future you'll leave us later on

Now that we know!  
Now that you know!  
We'll take the starlights, a new world  
They will take all we loved within us  
Might have this world, we'll win, win all the battles  
My love, my will, with me in the space

Gotta hope, the world with them, be in our bond...

Now we have united the world  
These could be the last moments of our lives  
No matter how, they'd be stealing the time that comes  
Now we have united the stars  
Gotta put the past that lingers behind  
There must be, the future you'll leave us later on

Now that we know!  
Now that you know!  
We'll take the starlights, a new world  
They will take all we loved within us  
Might have this world, we'll win, win all the battles  
My love, my will, with me in the space

Gotta hope, the world with them, be in our bond...  
Forever!
