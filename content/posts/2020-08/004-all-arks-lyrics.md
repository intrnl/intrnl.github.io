(Benovelent stars are passing the time)  
(Calling on, to all of his heroes)  
(Battle stars!)

Never a simple hand, dealt for the times  
In the wake of dawn, our battles carving up our better days  
But we are made to believe, that this is all  
We are only what we're meant to be, let us break that ray

All ARKS we ready go, in water, on land or in the sky  
Stand the place, are all fit back in our hands  
If a way that we must go, hope in our melody  
That it lies in our right to be free, Xiao thought he was really clear  
It's supposed to be!

Whatever the odds, you stand to fight tomorrow!  
Bring up the will to be, so much more than what's believed to be!  
No matter the odds you stand to fight, bring us upon a better life  
Only then may we to see, only then we are to be  
Only then are we to break from the bond that exists, it's a matter of time!

Never undo a plan, taking its time  
If the wait is worth, to hold onto the right move to bring better ways  
No, we are born to exceed, even if all  
We are so much more than we thought to be, so much more to be

All ARKS we ready go, in water, on land or in the sky  
Stand the place, are all fit back in our hands  
Make a way for us to go, tap into bravery  
To be rising a fight to achieve, fear nothing fear no enemies  
Answer the call to fight!

Whatever it takes the will, the might to take tomorrow!  
The heart of the warrior, is what gets us up to fight again!  
Whatever the cause to make to be, the wishes that our ship left to be  
So that one day we will see, so that one day we may be  
As the ones that gave ourselves for the land to be free, to inspire us all!

Whatever it takes the will, the might to take tomorrow!  
The heart of the warrior, is what gets us up to fight again!  
Whatever the cause to make to be, the wishes that our ship left to be  
So that one day we will see, so that one day we may be  
As the ones that gave ourselves for the land to be free, to inspire us all!
