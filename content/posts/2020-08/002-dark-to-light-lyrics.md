We rise, up from the bottom of the depth  
To forge a path  
Starlight shines through the darkness  
(Starlight shines through the dark)  
Heralding new hope  
(Heralding new hope)  

A hopeless world  
(A hopeless world)  
With the reaper's tears keep falling  
(With the raider's song and prayers bring us the believer)  
Break these chains of pain  
(Break these chains of pain)  
That's the only path left  
(A voice leads us, now the only path)  

Hey, what did you say?  
or what I said?  
Yes, I said to you through time and space  
I wanna be with you

You showed me the light  
Go, save the world, together today  
Whatever it takes stars shine again  
Light in our hearts!

Hey, what did you say?  
or what I said?  
Yes, I said to you back on planet Earth  
I'll save you next time

You made me stronger  
This future is both, yours and mine  
End this world, forever!

You set my soul free  
I won't lose the key to faith in myself  
Like you said, it's in the bond, you've created to win  
As a bond that spans in the whole universe  
See the true light!

We're not alone anymore  
You are special to all of us, you give infinite power  
Our life goes on, no matter what darkness we face  
We won't stop!

You're not alone anymore  
You are special to all the world, let love and light shine forth!  
And the wishes, of every living thing, will come true  
Open our eyes to the light of truth, make it a vow  
We are all ARKS!

Believe in yourself...  
Just don't lose hope in light...  
When new day, we all fight together...  
... 'til the end!

---

Remember, what you said?  
Remember, you said to me  
By the time, like this  
I wanna be with you

You know what we gotta do, to save the future  
No matter the ends, hell to pay  
Let's make stars shine again  
Light in our hearts

Remember, what you said?  
Remember, you said to me  
Way back there, like this  
I'll save you next time

You made us stronger than you think  
The future you have found  
We'll end this war, forever!

Your soul is free, keep this in your hearts  
You need a key, a belief, to save a loved one  
Like you said, the truth lies in the bond, you've created with us  
A bond that spans the whole universe  
I see the true light!

We're not alone, nothing can erase our memories  
To all of us, they give infinite power  
Our journey, won't end until we grab that shining  
Hope in our hands

You're not alone, no one controls our destiny  
To all the world, let love and light shine forth!  
And the wishes, of every living thing, will come true  
Open our eyes, make it happen now  
We are all ARKS!

Face it and survive...  
Just don't lose in tomorrow!  
For the brand new day, we all fight together...  
... 'til the end!

(Two parts are mixed together)

Stood against the odds  
Here at last, a new bright future  
Stood against the odds  
Here at last, a new bright future

Unraveling stories (Unraveling)  
Stories untold (Stories untold)  
Unraveling times to be told  
Underneath the vivid sky of our dreams!

Phantasy alight, our life  
(All of our dreams come true)  
Phantasy alight, our life  
(Into a new bright future)  
Phantasy Star shine, our dreams come true  
Finally! (Finally!)  
In The Whole New World!

Phantasy Star!  
(Phantasy, Phantasy Star!)  
Phantasy Star!

Our... Star!
