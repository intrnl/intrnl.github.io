What should I do for you?  
What was my real wish, ah  
The right path, I can't find it anymore  
I never meant to hurt you  
But you are very bright

What should I do for you?  
I'm the one who left you here  
The same path, you can feel my presence  
I have heard your fate and sad song  
But this world was saved by your will

Going back to womb  
The birth of our universe  
We were always together  
Finally, goodbye  
The day has arrived

I am so proud of you  
Cannot change the result of the war  
Around and round  
Wanna break the chain of history  
But you're gone, I'm so sorry  
I know, everything starts from here, and ends here

Crying your Phantasy  
I'll get out of the sadness through  
Our sympathy  
Into the threads of a brand new chain  
In the dark, you will be, a star, shining within me too  
I'm grateful for you

I am so proud of you  
Cannot change the result of the war  
Around and round  
Wanna break the chain of history  
But you're gone, I'm so sorry  
I know, everything starts from here, and ends here

Crying your Phantasy  
I'll get out of the sadness through  
Our sympathy  
Into the threads of a brand new chain  
In the air, you will be, a light, and shining on everything  
I'm grateful, for you

...you...

Here is the past...  
The future is here...
