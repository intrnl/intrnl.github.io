Hello to life, and all you've given me  
Revelling in this starry Phantasy  
Finally here, have I lived up to be?  
Do you feel the same?

Infinite bonds all throughout space and time  
Stories unfold promising futures untold  
Sovereign light throughout the darkness  
Hand in hand, here we stand  
Under the unyielding radiance of tomorrow

Aria of new beginnings  
Regal light illuminating cosmic seas alight  
Know in your heart, that we stand strong as one  
Sacrifice, overcome (We are one, we are one)  
We are one (We are one)    
We are one (We are one)    
We are one! (one!)

Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart  
Our fates aligned, intertwined  
A prelude to a brand new start  
Sailing anew, all of our dreams come true  
Thank you for all the boundless joy you gave me

Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts  
You gave us strength and courage to keep on  
I'll live true to me, I'll live bright and free  
I'll live on to make all brand new memories

Phantasy Star...

Seeds of hope, fluttering through the wind  
Blossoming through wistful gales of sorrow  
Sailing through, so deep into the unknown  
Finally the storm subsides  
Basking all the painted skies of morrow

A miracle, finally we've made it here (oh, the Oracle)  
Relentless battles that brought us to our knees  
(What lies ahead, our stellar fantasy)  
Kept in my heart, that we all stood as one  
(that we all stood strong together as one)  
Sacrificed, overcame (we've made it to the end, together hand in hand)  
We are one (We are one)    
We are one (We are one)    
We are one! (one!)

Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts  
Our fates aligned, intertwined  
A prelude to a brand new start  
Sailing anew, all of our dreams come true  
Thank you for all the boundless joy you gave us

Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts  
Finally all of our dreams have come true  
I'll live up to be, I'll live out my dreams  
I'll live out to make all brand new memories

Phantasy, Phantasy Star!  
Phantasy Star!

(永遠のencore / Endless Encore arrangement)  
(Living on like stars arrangement)  
(Hello arrangement)  
(光の果て / End of Light arrangement)

Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts  
All of our hearts and dreams have come true  
We'll forever always be with you  
Forever, through and through  
Into a new bright future together

...Phantasy Star!

Luminous!

Stood against the odds  
Here at last, a new bright future!  
Stood against the odds  
Here at last, a new bright future!

Unraveling stories, unbeknownst to us  
(Unravelling, stories untold)  
Unravelling times to be told  
Underneath the vivid sky of our dreams!

Phantasy alight, alive!  
(All of our dreams come true)  
Phantasy alight, alive!  
(Into a new bright future)  
Phantasy Star shine, our dreams come true  
Finally! (finally!)  
In the whole new world!

Phantasy Star!  
(Phantasy, Phantasy Star!)  
Phantasy Star!

Our... Star!
