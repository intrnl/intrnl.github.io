What should I do for you?  
What was my real wish, ah...  
The right path, I can't find it anymore

I never meant to hurt you  
I hear the scream of your sad soul  
It's true...

Living for yourself, living on like stars shining  
My heart for you is a peaceful light  
Yes, everything has light and darkness, I know  
But I wanna save the world  
I'm sorry, dear...

Praying for your future  
Praying for the starlight  
It's time to let go of the past  
I do feel your love, but the story is endless  
Please don't go back to your fate

Cause you are just like my child  
So you're my only star...
