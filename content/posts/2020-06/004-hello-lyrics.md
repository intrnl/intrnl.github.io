Smile, ear to ear  
It's wonderful what you've given me  
A new light to see, the world again, as I'd never seen

But how can I rid this sorrow away that lingers inside of me  
And how can I live up to the love you gave,  
When you saved me from the dark?

Bright stars to see  
How beautiful all you've given me  
Once more I feel, more than I ever felt before

But how can this be the way it's to be,  
If you are not here to see?  
And how can this all be how it's meant to be

But I'll carry on  
I promise you

Hello, to life, to everything  
There is so much yet to see, and more to be  
I have you in my heart in every breath I take  
Now it's up to me to be who I am

Once more I am, because of you  
You have given me a way to carry on  
Journey of my life  
Commence the moment you led me to that someone  
The one

Time does move on  
No mattter how for no matter who  
Still, from the lost  
A new begins, I begin with you

I fell asleep that night, woke to you  
Standing in front me  
It was as if you popped right out of my dreams,  
Just to rescue me

I dreamed to be

With you, from now, through everything  
I can see a whole new world with you beside  
I was lost too long, didn't know the right from wrong  
Now it's crystal clear who I wish to be

I hope in time, you'd feel the same  
For as long as I'm with you, I'm satisfied  
Nothing I won't do to save you when you need me to  
When you need me to

How can we save all we hold so dear  
When it's one or the other  
Hardly fair the choices we're to make  
But we need to, for better times

Hello, to life, to everything  
There is so much yet to see, and more to be  
I have you in my heart in every breath I take  
Now it's up to be who I am

Thank you to all, to everyone  
For the time you shared with us, through all the years  
Journey of my life  
Impossible if not for you  
Not for you, and you

(Hello, to life, to everything)  
(With you, from now, through everything)  
(Hello, to life, to everything)  
(I hope in time, you'd feel the same)
