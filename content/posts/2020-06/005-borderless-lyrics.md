Fantasies can come from wings  
Sometimes it's a nursery tale  
At other times, it's a gloomy and stormy night

Fantasies can seem so real  
Because I felt so sad  
Searching for my own fate  
Yes I will never give it up

We are borderless

Across time and space, we can sail  
Blaze all borders with you  
Shining stars waiting for you, forever  
Take me to many planets, if you can do it

Fight on past the space frontier  
Keep on, we are just space travelers  
We do it for our treasures

We are borderless

Fight on past the space frontier  
Keep on, we are just space travelers  
Beyond imagination

We are borderless!

In your eyes, am I alive?  
or still I might not be here now?  
Which one do you choose?  
Truth is not all there is

In your mind, what can you see?  
It's not clear between,  
The past and future  
We have to fight

In my eyes, what should I believe?  
Always been here, so I imagine  
But I can't bear,  
I want to break free from my fear

It's not clear between,  
Dreams and reality  
Oh it's strange, but it's just true  
We have to let go
