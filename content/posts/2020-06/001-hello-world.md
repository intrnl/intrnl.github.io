I've always been a naturally curious person, always wanting to learn new things
especially with new technologies and electronics. They're cool, but wouldn't it
be better if I share my thoughts too?

I've contemplated about creating a personal blog several times, but never
went ahead with it. I'm scared of people, thinking that my thoughts will be
perceived as lame by some. Perhaps that's just imposter syndrome at work, and
if I don't do this now, it would be hard to get it over with.

So I did it. Are you happy now?
