Standing still, I look to the sky  
I want to see your tomorrow  
Let my soul stay in your heart  
If our destiny comes to ruin  

Life is given from the heavens  
We still see how small we are  
The stream of time
Some petals in the wind  
I hear them sing in my ear  
Their sweetest songs ease my mind  

I am with you, always with you  
Even when you forget to smile  
The words I say, keep them in your heart  
Forever and ever, I'm yours  

With some tears  
I do love you with no fears  
I am so warm from the day spent with you  

In this world, busy world  
We may lose our smiling faces  
No hope but fear  
That's what I had at that time  
It is you that encouraged me  
Now I believe in our future  

I am with you forever  
Even if you're lost in the world  
I look back on the days spent with you  
What I say is I will be with you  

I tell you  
Now I've found my strength  
That is the gift of your love  
Your love
